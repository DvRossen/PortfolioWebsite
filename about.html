        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is D v. Rossen born 17feb 2003.</p>
        <p>I'm from the Netherlands and I speak both English and Dutch, though I'm horribly dyslexic so please call me out on any grammatical errors I make.</p>
        <p>My key values are mostly about inclusion. I like making everything I develop accessible for others,
            either by having readable text for other dyslexic people or by structuring h elements in such a way that they are usabel with a screen reader among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests include art, music, videogames, coding and just making stuff in general.
            I really like working on front end development and designing stuff like websites and applications. I am currently able to work in basic html css, I can also work in JavaScript and Typescript. 
            I've recently tried learning react, I have a long way to go but I can make basic webpages and functions in it already.
            I make art myself, this can be found on the <a href="underConstruction.html">gallery page</a> but I like other's art a lot too!
            Recently I've started listening to more music, and it's inspired me to start learning how to play an instrument myself.
            I like playing videogames a lot I mostly play sandbox games like terraria and minecraft, like I said I like making things.
            I am learning to make videogames myself as well!
            Eventually I want to combine all these interests together and make a game using my own sprites, music and code.

            I'm currently in college learning Creative Media and Game Technologies. I've put up work I've done for this study on the <a href="tle.html">college work page</a>.
            <!-- CLE stands for Creative Learning Environment, this is a program my school ran in year one where you get to work on different projects while learning about the subjects regarding them.
            For CLE so far I've made a robot called Jerry out of cardboard and programmed him to respond to certain inputs, made a website for an actual client using php,
            designed an application for an entire neighborhood and attempted to make a videogame using object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Overal I really enjoy this study even if it can be stressful at times. -->
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            I've uploaded some of my projects for CLE to my <a href="">youtube channel</a>. I also plan to upload more there when I have more video content to push out.
            you can find my channel among other links on my <a href="socials.html">socials page</a>.

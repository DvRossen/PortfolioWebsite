        <h1>CLE</h1>
        <p>
            On this page I'll talk about the different projects I've worked on during my the time at my college.
            For some extra context, the year I took CLE we had a different way on how to test our knowledge. We had to write something called "Building Blocks".
            Each building block we'd had to explain what we did in a certain category of our study and show our results.
            Each period of CLE has around three different building blocks we had to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this website is for an assignment in period one I will only be sharing the building blocks for the first period,
            with the possibility of expanding later.
        </p>

        <h1> Period one</h1>
        <p>In this period we had our introductions to the area and the school, after this we started learning how to work with the Crickit.
            With the Crickit we made a two robot prototypes and after that a battle robot! The Building Blocks for this period were
            <a href="#bb1">Clever</a>,
            <a href="#bb2">Pitch Perfect</a> and
            <a href="#bb3">Iron Man</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="bb1">Clever</h2>
        <p>For this Building Block we had to familiarize ourselves with the study and how Building Blocks worked.
        We learned how to submit on the school site, and we had to write about our fellow students, the teachers and our coaches.
        I didn't really get any results to show though.</p>
        <h2 id="bb2">Pitch Perfect</h2>
        <p>For this building block we had to pitch robots that add a function to their assigned category.
            The category I chose was healthcare, within this category I chose care for mentally disabled people specifically.
            I did this because my mother worked with mentally disabled people and choosing this category could help me get closer to my target audience.
            I settled on making a robot for visual and auditory stimulation, I called him Jerry.</p>

            <p>
                I had to write about with what pitches inspired me and how I use those techniques in my pitch.
                I did two pitches in total, for both pitches I made separate designs for Jerry.
                One was the first draught it was made out of an old cardboard box and basically only had one function that when he got shaken his arms would move.
                The second one was when I actually went to my target audience and got feedback from them I made this version of
                Jerry move his arms when it's shaken, light up when a certain side of him got touched and made him sing a song whenever he heard a loud sound.

        </article>
        <p>
            This is the pitch where I pitched the second Jerry.
            I basically only got good feedback from this pitch I could relatively shortly explain the functions of Jerry and kept my audience captivated by including them in the overall story.
        </p>
        <h2 id="bb3">Iron Man</h2>
        <p>
            For this building block I had to prove that I could build a robot.
            I had to prove I could work with the Crickit that I could write code using it and execute it and that I could make a robot from sturdy material.
            My first robot was Jerry where I eventually had a pretty good inside layout.
        </p>

            <img alt="Picture of code written for the cardboard robot" src="utils/img/codeJerry.png">
        </picture>
        <p>
            As you can see here I worked with the Crickit, yet I didn't build Jerry out of sturdy material.
            This is where ramp-bot came. I built ramp balls out of wood nails and glue I did it in such a way that he to this day didn't break.
            I also wrote code for ramp-bot.

        <h1> Period two</h1>
        <p>In this period we had our first real programming courses and start learning about the design process.
            We started with the basics of php in programming and ended with a linked database and password verification.
            In terms of Design we learned how to look for user stories and how to make a site map.

            More coming soon...

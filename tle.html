        <h1>TLE 1</h1>
        <p>
            Together with my team, I developed a web application to prevent misconduct.
            The main focus of our application was to connect people with confidants to talk about their experiences with misconduct and get them help.
            The project was developed for TLE (Tailored Learning Environment), and our team consisted of Mark Hobbel, Sasha Salmon, Sena Babacan, Marijn Hokke, and myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took on the role of designer and was responsible for designing the layout of the application and helping to improve the user experience through testing.
            Through this project, I learned that designing is not just about placing buttons and lines of text, but also about accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website was created with the lessons learned from the project in mind.
            I drew inspiration from the project, using some of the unused designs, such as the navigation bar and color scheme.
            Accessibility was also taken into account, ensuring that every image had an alt tag and that tags such as h1 were not overused, making the site screen reader friendly.
